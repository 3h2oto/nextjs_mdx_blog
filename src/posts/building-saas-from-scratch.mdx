_Startups sound exciting, right?_&nbsp; Coming up with a new idea or finding a unique problem to solve is a challenge - especially today, when nearly every concept seems to already exist somewhere in the world. And if you're building a startup in this competitive market, hats off to you!

Anyway, let me take you behind the scenes of _my journey building a full-stack SaaS application for a startup - from scratch, as a solo developer, and all the way to production._&nbsp;

### What is Tapify

Tapify redefines **networking with digital business cards** for modern teams. Unlike traditional cards, Tapify **cards use NFC and QR** technology, allowing users to instantly share contact details without needing an app.

> It’s as simple as “tap and share,” much like tap-to-pay services.

You can also store your Tapify card in **Apple or Google Wallet** for easy access. Tapify combines innovation with environmental impact, replacing paper cards with a professional, eco-friendly solution.

### Process of Building

For me, it's not just about contributing - it's about taking full ownership of the project. At Tapify, I received the Figma design files, and as a solo developer, I was responsible for creating the logic and finding solutions.

I took on the task of building the entire user-facing web application. I handled everything from frontend to backend, as well as security and performance. Every issue was something I debugged and fixed on my own.

Here's a glimpse of my work:

### Teck Stack

Building Tapify from the ground up was incredibly exciting. As the sole developer, I had complete control over the project, which allowed me to quickly identify and fix bugs or issues right away. I used a **cutting-edge tech stack** and followed industry best practices to keep the code **type-safe** and **maintainable for future updates** and changes.

### Learnings

> You don’t need to be perfect to start; you just need a willingness to learn along the way.

To be honest, I learned a lot at Tapify. I gained a deeper **understanding of databases** and **database modeling**, as well as how to write **clean**, **maintainable**, and **type-safe code**. When I started, I was a bit nervous about handling everything on my own, but over time I realized that no one is perfect from the beginning.

_Building software is like a game - you don’t know what the next obstacle will be. We advance level by level, learning as we go._
