_Startups sound exciting, right?_&nbsp; Coming up with a new idea or finding a unique problem to solve is a challenge - especially today, when nearly every concept seems to already exist somewhere in the world. And if you're building a startup in this competitive market, hats off to you!

Anyway, let me take you behind the scenes of _my journey building a full-stack SaaS application for a startup - from scratch, as a solo developer, and all the way to production._&nbsp;

### What is Tapify

Tapify redefines **networking with digital business cards** for modern teams. Unlike traditional cards, Tapify **cards use NFC and QR** technology, allowing users to instantly share contact details without needing an app.

> It’s as simple as “tap and share,” much like tap-to-pay services.

You can also store your Tapify card in **Apple or Google Wallet** for easy access.

Tapify combines innovation with environmental impact, replacing paper cards with a professional, eco-friendly solution.

### Process of Building

For me, it's not just about contributing - it's about taking full ownership of the project. At Tapify, I received the Figma design files, and as a solo developer, I was responsible for creating the logic and finding solutions.

I took on the task of building the entire user-facing web application. I handled everything from **frontend** to **backend**, as well as **security** and **performance**. Every issue was something I debugged and fixed on my own.

Here's a glimpse of my work:

### Teck Stack

Building Tapify from the ground up as the sole developer on the team, while working closely with the founder, was an incredibly exciting experience. Every single line of code was written by me, enabling me to quickly identify and resolve any bugs or issues that occurred.

I used a **cutting-edge tech stack** and followed industry best practices to keep the code **type-safe** and **maintainable for future updates** and changes.

### Learnings

> Ideas don't come out fully formed, they only become clearer as you work on them. - Mark Zuckerberg

To be honest, I learned a lot at Tapify. I gained a deeper **understanding of databases** and **database modeling**, as well as how to write **clean**, **maintainable**, and **type-safe code**.

When I started, I was a bit nervous about handling everything on my own, but over time I realized that no one is perfect from the beginning. You don’t need to be perfect to start, you just need a willingness to learn along the way.
