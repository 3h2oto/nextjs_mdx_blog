## Introduction

Building a SaaS product from scratch is a unique and rewarding experience, especially when you get to develop every aspect of it, from architecture to deployment. In this blog, I'll walk you through the journey of building **Tapify**, a modern solution created to replace an outdated PHP Laravel application. This project was an excellent opportunity to apply the latest technologies and build a product that thousands of users now rely on daily.

## Project Overview

**Tapify** is a user-facing web application that allows businesses to manage and customize user information efficiently. The product’s design, tech stack, and deployment were chosen to ensure scalability, speed, and seamless user experience. Tapify's successful launch has given me valuable insights that I am excited to share.

### Why a Modern Tech Stack?

Replacing an older product with a modern solution allowed me to leverage tools and frameworks designed for optimal performance and developer productivity. Each choice in the tech stack contributed to Tapify's effectiveness and maintainability. Here’s a breakdown of the technologies I used:

- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-rendered and static pages, resulting in faster load times.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first approach, enabling a clean, responsive design.
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a streamlined UI library that integrated smoothly with the project.

### Core Features and Architecture

Tapify was built with a combination of modular tools and services to handle data processing, authentication, payments, and more. Here’s a quick overview of the tech stack and its purpose within the application:

1. **ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.dev/) provided a type-safe, efficient ORM for data manipulation.
2. **Database**: [Supabase PostgreSQL](https://supabase.io/) for secure, scalable data storage.
3. **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) kept the frontend’s state predictable and easy to manage.
4. **Query Handling**: [TanStack Queries](https://tanstack.com/query) facilitated efficient data fetching and caching.
5. **API Handling**: Server Actions in Next.js enabled seamless backend interactions.

### Integrations for Enhanced Functionality

Building a SaaS product means implementing various integrations for payment, communication, and other essential functions:

- **Payment Integration**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) powers secure transactions.
- **Email Services**: [Resend](https://resend.com/) for reliable, scalable email handling.
- **Wallets**: Integrated Apple and Google Wallets for user convenience.
- **Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for ensuring data integrity.

### Deployment and Scaling

For deployment, I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), known for its developer-friendly experience and rapid deployment capabilities. Additionally, rate limiting with [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) helped in managing API requests effectively to avoid potential abuse.

### Role-Based Authentication

Using Next.js Parallel Routes, I implemented a role-based authentication system. This feature enables different levels of access based on user roles, ensuring that users have the correct permissions without sacrificing performance or security.

### Lessons Learned

This project emphasized the importance of:

- **Component Reusability**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui made it easy to create reusable components.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizing Vercel’s insights helped fine-tune the app’s performance and load times.
- **Scalability**: Supabase’s managed PostgreSQL setup allowed Tapify to scale effectively as user demand grew.

## Conclusion

Building Tapify from scratch has been a valuable learning experience and a significant career milestone. This project gave me a chance to leverage cutting-edge technology to create a scalable, user-friendly SaaS product that’s now a key tool for its users.
