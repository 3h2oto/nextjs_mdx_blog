In tech, people often ask: _"Generalist or specialist?"_ After working in the field, I've found that being a **jack of many trades** is powerful.

The tech job market is tough right now. Fierce competition, oversupply of talent with lower demand. Having other skillsets is **crucial** to stay current and grow.

### From Designer to Developer

I started as a UI designer, making things look good and easy to use. But I soon realized I needed to learn coding to get better. Understanding how things are built became important.

_"As designers, we often obsess over pixel-perfect mockups. But understanding development allows us to create interfaces that are not only beautiful but feasible to implement."_ &nbsp;This cross-disciplinary knowledge fosters collaboration and leads to superior products.

This pushed me to become a frontend engineer, where I found new challenges and chances to grow. _Why not a design engineer?_ &nbsp;cI still need to learn a lot more about this field.

### Standing Out

As a frontend engineer, I know many people can do the basics like turning designs into websites, cutting up designs from Figma, and handling core technical needs. To be different, I had to **do more** and need to be unique in some way. I used my design background to add extra skills.

### How it’s going

> A portfolio is the project that's never really finished.

Ain't that the truth? It's like a digital playground that I can't stop tinkering with. After pouring countless nights and weekends into this, I've landed on a design that screams _less is more_.

Big shoutout to the UI wizards who inspired me: [Julien Thibeaut](#), [Emil Kowalski](#), [Rauno Freiberg](#), [Paco Coursey](#), [Lee Robinson](#), and others for the inspiration. These folks motivated me to cut the fluff and focus on what really matters.

### Wrapping Up

This refresh taught me that building something meaningful isn’t just about the tools and techniques. It’s about paying attention to the details—whether it's choosing the right fonts, creating smooth interactions, or crafting a layout that just feels right.

I’m proud of how it turned out and excited to share more of my work here. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore!
