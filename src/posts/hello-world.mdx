# Being a Generalist

In tech, people often ask: _"Generalist or specialist?"_ After working in the field, I've found that being a **jack of many trades** is powerful.

The tech job market is tough right now. Fierce competition, oversupply of talent with lower demand. Having other skillsets is **crucial** to stay current and grow.

### From Designer to Developer

I started as a UI designer, making things look good and easy to use. But I soon realized I needed to learn coding to get better. Understanding how things are built became important.

_"As designers, we often obsess over pixel-perfect mockups. But understanding development allows us to create interfaces that are not only beautiful but feasible to implement."_ &nbsp;This cross-disciplinary knowledge fosters collaboration and leads to superior products.

This pushed me to become a frontend engineer, where I found new challenges and chances to grow. _Why not a design engineer?_ &nbsp;cI still need to learn a lot more about this field.

### Standing Out

As a frontend engineer, I know many people can do the basics like turning designs into websites, cutting up designs from Figma, and handling core technical needs. To be different, I had to **do more** and need to be unique in some way. I used my design background to add extra skills.
