There's a significant difference between watching tutorials and actually building something. While tutorials are great starting points, the real learning happens when you open your code editor and start typing.

### Learning Philosophy

> The best way to learn is by doing - start small, but start today.

I've discovered that the best way to learn any new technology is to build something from scratch with it. Yes, from scratch.

While using templates and starters might seem faster, building from the ground up forces you to understand every piece of the puzzle.

Here's my approach:

- Project-Based Learning: <br/> _I learn new tech by building projects around it, like using Drizzle ORM in a todo app or exploring Hono.js and Cloudflare Workers through serverless APIs._

- Smart Use of AI: <br/> _I use tools like ChatGPT and Claude as learning aids to understand concepts, not just copy answers. For me, experimenting and building is key to grasping the material._

### Freelancing

Building small side projects helped me learn, but I wanted a bigger challenge, so I created a full-fledged clone of Meta's Threads platform. This project even led to a freelancing opportunity, which was really exciting for me.

My approach to building projects is structured as follows:

- Set up the frontend architecture
- Establish the backend structure
- Focus on core functionality
- Optimize progressively
- Ensure pixel-perfect implementation

This methodical approach helped me maintain code quality while steadily progressing toward a polished final product.

### Wrapping Up

Getting paid to do what you love is indeed amazing, but the journey to get there is equally important. Every small project, every line of code, and every debugging session contributes to your growth as a developer.
