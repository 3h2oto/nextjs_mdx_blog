As developers, it's easy to get focused on making things that are technically cool, but they don't always solve real problems. The most satisfying projects, though, are the ones that tackle real challenges people face every day. This is the story of how I created PDFScribe — a tool that turned a frustrating, time-consuming task into a simple, automated solution for e-commerce sellers.

### Sellers Problem

If you're an e-commerce seller on platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho (major players in the Indian e-commerce space), you're probably all too familiar with the shipping label chaos. Let me paint a picture of what sellers deal with daily:

Imagine you're a successful seller processing hundreds of orders. At the end of the day, you have a massive PDF file with 500+ shipping labels. Now comes the tedious part:

- Manually scanning through hundreds of pages
- Separating labels by different delivery partners
- Identifying and grouping exchange orders
- Finding and bundling multi-order shipments
- Cropping out tax invoices from each label

This process isn't just time-consuming, it's mind-numbing and error-prone. One mistake could mean a misrouted package or a delayed shipment.

### Solution

To help sellers focus on what truly matters — growing their business. I built PDFScribe. It's a specialized tool that automates the entire shipping label management process. Here's what it does:

1. **Simple Upload**: Just drag and drop your shipping label PDF
2. **Automatic Processing**:
   - Intelligently crops out tax invoices
   - Identifies and groups labels by delivery partner
   - Flags and sorts exchange orders
   - Bundles multi-order shipments
3. **Zero Infrastructure Cost**: Runs entirely in the browser

Here is visualization of how it works:

### Learnings

> Don't try to solve everyone’s problems—focus on very niche issues and solve them well.

PDFScribe isn’t built for everyone; it’s specifically designed for Meesho sellers. Building it was more than just coding—it was a valuable learning experience. Initially, it seemed straightforward, but as I dove in, I faced challenges, especially around PDF processing. One major hurdle was the cost-effectiveness of handling large PDFs on the server. Processing these tasks server-side would have made the tool expensive to maintain. After extensive research and experimentation, I found ways to handle everything on the web, without relying on servers or adding extra costs.

So, focus on building things that solve specific problems effectively.
