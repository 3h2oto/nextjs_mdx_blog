As developers, some of the most rewarding projects are those that solve real-world challenges and make life easier for others.

This is the story of how I created **PDFScribe** — _a tool that turned a frustrating, time consuming task into a simple, automated solution for e-commerce sellers._

### Sellers Problem

If you're an e-commerce seller on platforms like **Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho** (major players in the Indian e-commerce space), you're probably all too familiar with the shipping label chaos.

Let me paint a picture of what sellers deal with daily:

Imagine you’re a successful seller processing hundreds of orders. By the end of the day, you’re left with a single PDF containing **500+ shipping labels**. Then begins the painstaking task of:

- Manually scanning through hundreds of pages
- Separating labels by different delivery partners
- Identifying and grouping exchange orders
- Finding and bundling multi-order shipments
- Cropping out tax invoices from each label

This process isn't just time-consuming, it's mind-numbing and error-prone. One mistake could mean a misrouted package or a delayed shipment.

### Solution

To **help sellers** focus on what truly matters - growing their business. I built PDFScribe. It's a specialized tool that automates the entire shipping label management process.

Here's how PDFScribe works:

1. **Simple Upload**: <br/>
   Just drag and drop your shipping label PDF

2. **Automatic Processing**:

   - Intelligently crops out tax invoices
   - Identifies and groups labels by delivery partner
   - Flags and sorts exchange orders
   - Bundles multi-order shipments

3. **Zero Infrastructure Cost**: <br/>
   PDFScribe runs in the browser with no need for extra tools or infrastructure.

### Learnings

> Focus on solving a niche problem that a small group cares deeply about, not a broad one no one feels strongly about. - Sam Altman

PDFScribe isn’t built for everyone; it’s specifically designed for Meesho sellers.

I learned a lot while building this project. At first, I thought it would be easy. But working with PDF files was tricky. The main problem was that processing big PDFs on servers would cost too much money. After lots of research, I found a way to do everything in the web browser instead. This saved money and worked better.

This taught me how important it is to **find good solutions to specific problems**.
