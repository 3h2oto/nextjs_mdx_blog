// ## Project Overview

// **Tapify** is a user-facing web application that allows businesses to manage and customize user information efficiently. The product’s design, tech stack, and deployment were chosen to ensure scalability, speed, and seamless user experience. Tapify's successful launch has given me valuable insights that I am excited to share.

// ### Why a Modern Tech Stack?

// Replacing an older product with a modern solution allowed me to leverage tools and frameworks designed for optimal performance and developer productivity. Each choice in the tech stack contributed to Tapify's effectiveness and maintainability. Here’s a breakdown of the technologies I used:

// - **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-rendered and static pages, resulting in faster load times.
// - **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first approach, enabling a clean, responsive design.
// - **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a streamlined UI library that integrated smoothly with the project.

// ### Core Features and Architecture

// Tapify was built with a combination of modular tools and services to handle data processing, authentication, payments, and more. Here’s a quick overview of the tech stack and its purpose within the application:

// 1. **ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.dev/) provided a type-safe, efficient ORM for data manipulation.
// 2. **Database**: [Supabase PostgreSQL](https://supabase.io/) for secure, scalable data storage.
// 3. **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) kept the frontend’s state predictable and easy to manage.
// 4. **Query Handling**: [TanStack Queries](https://tanstack.com/query) facilitated efficient data fetching and caching.
// 5. **API Handling**: Server Actions in Next.js enabled seamless backend interactions.

// ### Integrations for Enhanced Functionality

// Building a SaaS product means implementing various integrations for payment, communication, and other essential functions:

// - **Payment Integration**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) powers secure transactions.
// - **Email Services**: [Resend](https://resend.com/) for reliable, scalable email handling.
// - **Wallets**: Integrated Apple and Google Wallets for user convenience.
// - **Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for ensuring data integrity.

// ### Deployment and Scaling

// For deployment, I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), known for its developer-friendly experience and rapid deployment capabilities. Additionally, rate limiting with [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) helped in managing API requests effectively to avoid potential abuse.

// ### Role-Based Authentication

// Using Next.js Parallel Routes, I implemented a role-based authentication system. This feature enables different levels of access based on user roles, ensuring that users have the correct permissions without sacrificing performance or security.

// ### Lessons Learned

// This project emphasized the importance of:

// - **Component Reusability**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui made it easy to create reusable components.
// - **Performance Optimization**: Utilizing Vercel’s insights helped fine-tune the app’s performance and load times.
// - **Scalability**: Supabase’s managed PostgreSQL setup allowed Tapify to scale effectively as user demand grew.

// ## Conclusion

// Building Tapify from scratch has been a valuable learning experience and a significant career milestone. This project gave me a chance to leverage cutting-edge technology to create a scalable, user-friendly SaaS product that’s now a key tool for its users.

// The tech job market is tough right now. Fierce competition, oversupply of talent with lower demand. Having other skillsets is **crucial** to stay current and grow.

// ### From Designer to Developer

// I started as a UI designer, making things look good and easy to use. But I soon realized I needed to learn coding to get better. Understanding how things are built became important.

// <Test />

// _"As designers, we often obsess over pixel-perfect mockups. But understanding development allows us to create interfaces that are not only beautiful but feasible to implement."_ &nbsp;This cross-disciplinary knowledge fosters collaboration and leads to superior products.

// This pushed me to become a frontend engineer, where I found new challenges and chances to grow. _Why not a design engineer?_ &nbsp;cI still need to learn a lot more about this field.

// ### Standing Out

// As a frontend engineer, I know many people can do the basics like turning designs into websites, cutting up designs from Figma, and handling core technical needs. To be different, I had to **do more** and need to be unique in some way. I used my design background to add extra skills.

// ### How it’s going

// > A portfolio is the project that's never really finished.

// Ain't that the truth? It's like a digital playground that I can't stop tinkering with. After pouring countless nights and weekends into this, I've landed on a design that screams _less is more_.

// Big shoutout to the UI wizards who inspired me: [Julien Thibeaut](#), [Emil Kowalski](#), [Rauno Freiberg](#), [Paco Coursey](#), [Lee Robinson](#), and others for the inspiration. These folks motivated me to cut the fluff and focus on what really matters.

// ### Wrapping Up

// This refresh taught me that building something meaningful isn’t just about the tools and techniques. It’s about paying attention to the details—whether it's choosing the right fonts, creating smooth interactions, or crafting a layout that just feels right.

// I’m proud of how it turned out and excited to share more of my work here. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore!
